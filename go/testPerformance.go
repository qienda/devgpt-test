# Go Slice Example

This program demonstrates the creation and manipulation of a large slice in Go.

## Overview

The program performs the following actions:

1. Initializes a timer to measure the execution time of the program.
2. Creates a large slice with an initial capacity of 10,000 elements.
3. Appends 10,000 integers to the slice in a loop.
4. Iterates over the slice and prints each value.
5. Measures and prints the total execution time of the program.

## Code

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    start := time.Now()

    // Create a very large slice
    slice := make([]int, 0, 10000)

    // Append to the slice in a loop
    for i := 0; i < 10000; i++ {
        slice = append(slice, i)
    }

    // Iterate over the slice and perform some operations
    for _, value := range slice {
        fmt.Println(value)
    }

    elapsed := time.Since(start)
    fmt.Printf("Program execution time: %s", elapsed)
}
```

## Execution Time

The execution time printed at the end of the program includes the time taken to append elements to the slice and to iterate over it. Note that the original code included a `time.Sleep(time.Millisecond)` call within the loop, which was removed to improve performance.

## Conclusion

This simple program is useful for understanding how slices work in Go and how to measure the execution time of a program segment.

package main

import (
"fmt"
"time"
)

func main() {
start := time.Now()

// 创建一个非常大的切片
slice := make([]int, 0, 10000)

// 对切片进行连续的追加操作
for i := 0; i < 10000; i++ {
slice = append(slice, i)
}

// 遍历切片并执行一些操作
for _, value := range slice {
// 模拟一些耗时的操作
// Simulate a time-consuming operation
// Previously, time.Sleep was causing the loop to sleep for each iteration, which is inefficient.
// The improved code removes the sleep from the loop to avoid unnecessary delays.

fmt.Println(value)
}

elapsed := time.Since(start)
fmt.Printf("程序执行时间：%s", elapsed)
}
